# Arkel Craft 
(Minecraft Clone)

### About
This is still a work in progress and only supports the bare minimum of being an adequate minecraft clone. It currently only spawns in 4 chunks in a flat world with a grass, dirt, and stone layer. You can place blocks by right clicking and remove blocks by left clicking. Currently a mesh is being generated for all the visable blocks in the chunk. It works, but it could be much faster. 


### Backlog (Priority high to low)
* Chunk generation
* Faster mesh generating
* Multiple placeable blocks
* Terrain Generation
* Trees
* Water
* Caves
